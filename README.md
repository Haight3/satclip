# üõ∞Ô∏è SatCLIP - A Global, General-Purpose Geographic Location Encoder

![CLIP](/figures/satclip.png)

## Approach

SatCLIP trains location and image encoders via contrastive learning, by matching images to their corresponding locations. This is analogous to the CLIP approach, which matches images to their corresponding text. Through this process, the location encoder learns characteristics of a location, as represented by satellite imagery.

## Overview

Usage of SatCLIP is simple:

```python
from model import *
from location_encoder import *

model = SatCLIP(
    embed_dim=512,
    image_resolution=224, in_channels=13, vision_layers=4, vision_width=768, vision_patch_size=32, # Image encoder
    le_type='sphericalharmonics', pe_type='siren', legendre_polys=10, frequency_num=16, max_radius=360, min_radius=1, harmonics_calculation='analytic'  # Location encoder
)

img_batch = torch.randn(32, 13, 224, 224) # Represents a batch of 32 images
loc_batch = torch.randn(32, 2) # Represents the corresponding 32 locations (lon/lat)

with torch.no_grad():
    logits_per_image, logits_per_coord = model(img_batch, loc_batch)
    probs = logits_per_image.softmax(dim=-1).detach().cpu().numpy()
```

## Training

You first need to download the *S2-100k* dataset in `/data/s2`. First, download the index file:
```bash
cd data/s2
wget https://satclip.z13.web.core.windows.net/satclip/index.csv
```
Within `/data/s2`, navigate to `/images`, download all images and unpack them:
```bash
cd images
wget https://satclip.z13.web.core.windows.net/satclip/satclip.tar
tar -xf satclip.tar
```

Now, to train **SatCLIP** models, set the paths correctly, adapt training configs in `clip/configs/default.yaml` and train GeoCLIP by running:
```bash
python clip/main.py
```

## Pretrained Models

We provide six pretrained SatCLIP models, trained with different vision encoders and spatial resolution hyperparameters $L$ (these indicate the number of Legendre polynomials used for spherical harmonics location encoding. Please refer to our paper for more details). The pretrained models can be downloaded as follows:
* SatCLIP-ResNet18-L10: `wget https://satclip.z13.web.core.windows.net/satclip/satclip-resnet18-l10.ckpt` 
* SatCLIP-ResNet18-L40: `wget https://satclip.z13.web.core.windows.net/satclip/satclip-resnet18-l40.ckpt` 
* SatCLIP-ResNet50-L10: `wget https://satclip.z13.web.core.windows.net/satclip/satclip-resnet50-l10.ckpt` 
* SatCLIP-ResNet50-L40: `wget https://satclip.z13.web.core.windows.net/satclip/satclip-resnet50-l40.ckpt` 
* SatCLIP-ViT16-L10: `wget https://satclip.z13.web.core.windows.net/satclip/satclip-vit16-l10.ckpt` 
* SatCLIP-ViT16-L40: `wget https://satclip.z13.web.core.windows.net/satclip/satclip-vit16-l40.ckpt` 

Usage of pretrained models is simple:
```python
from load import get_satclip

device = 'cuda'

c = torch.randn(32, 2) # Represents a batch of 32 locations (lon/lat)

model = get_satclip('path_to_satclip', device=device) #Only loads location encoder by default
model.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
  emb  = model(c.double().to(device)).detach().cpu()
```

## Experiments

Examples of how to use SatCLIP for downstream tasks will be added shortly.
