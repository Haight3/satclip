# üõ∞Ô∏è SatCLIP - A Global, General-Purpose Geographic Location Encoder

![CLIP](/figures/satclip.png)

## Approach

SatCLIP trains location and image encoders via contrastive learning, by matching images to their corresponding locations. This is analogous to the CLIP approach, which matches images to their corresponding text. Through this process, the location encoder learns characteristics of a location, as represented by satellite imagery.

## Overview

Usage of SatCLIP is simple:

```python
from satclip.model import *
from satclip.location_encoder import *

model = SatCLIP(
    embed_dim=512,
    image_resolution=224, in_channels=13, vision_layers=4, vision_width=768, vision_patch_size=32, # Image encoder
    le_type='sphericalharmonics', pe_type='siren', legendre_polys=10, frequency_num=16, max_radius=360, min_radius=1, harmonics_calculation='analytic'  # Location encoder
)

img_batch = torch.randn(32, 13, 224, 224) # Represents a batch of 32 images
loc_batch = torch.randn(32, 2) # Represents the corresponding 32 locations (lon/lat)

with torch.no_grad():
    logits_per_image, logits_per_coord = model(img_batch, loc_batch)
    probs = logits_per_image.softmax(dim=-1).detach().cpu().numpy()
```

## Training

You first need to download the *S2-100k* dataset 
in `/data/s2`:
```python
TODO
```

Now, set the paths correctly, adapt training configs in `clip/configs/default.yaml` and train GeoCLIP by running:
```bash
python clip/main.py
```
